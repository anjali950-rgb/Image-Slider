# Image-Slider
An Image Slider is a web component that displays a series of images in a slideshow format, either automatically or with user control (e.g., next/previous buttons).It enhances visual appeal and allows users to view multiple images without taking up much space. 
# Technologies Used:
•	HTML5 – Structure and content
•	CSS3 – Styling, transitions, and responsiveness
•	JavaScript – Functionality, interactivity, and event handling

# Project Objective
	To demonstrate basic front-end development concepts like:
•	DOM traversal and manipulation. 
•	Event handling.
•	Basic styling with CSS.
	To allow users to navigate forward and backward through a list of images.

# How to Use
1.	Clone or download the project files.
2.	Open the index.html file in a browser.
3.	Use the navigation buttons (Next, Previous) to slide through the images.

# How it works
•	HTML creates the structure and image containers.
•	CSS styles the image slider, navigation buttons, and layout.
•	JavaScript handles display the first image when the page loads.
•	Click on “Next” and “Previous” buttons to navigate through the images.
•	Loop back to the first image after reaching the last one.

# Future Enhancements
•	Add descriptive captions or overlay text for each image.
•	Use left/right arrow keys to move between slides.
•	Add navigation dots or small thumbnails to jump to specific slides.
•	Allow users to expand the slider to full screen using the Full screen API.
